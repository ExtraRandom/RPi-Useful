# RPi-Useful
A few small bash scripts I made for use on Raspberry Pi.

Feel free to take and modify.

### newfile
Argument: name for new file

Creates a new shell script file named whatever was input and chmod 777's said file. 

May change it to use 777 by default and accept a second argument to set a different permission level.  

### sys
Possible Arguments: r, h

Reboots or Halts based on input

### web
Possible Arguments: ip, flask, noip
Arugments for flask: start, stop, restart, status

For easy finding of web-related info as well as controlling the flask service.
